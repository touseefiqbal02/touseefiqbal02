I am a highly motivated MBA graduate with a solid foundation in Insurance and Risk Management, currently pursuing an MSc in Data Science at the University of Salford. This academic journey has equipped me with a unique combination of analytical, business, and technical skills. Proficient in Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn), SQL, and visualization tools such as Power BI and Tableau, I specialize in extracting actionable insights from complex datasets.
In my career, I have managed diverse insurance portfolios, conducted financial audits, and ensured the accuracy of financial records. I am currently honing my data science expertise through advanced coursework in areas like data mining, statistical analysis, and project risk management.
